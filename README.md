## File Description

### `index.html`

This file contains the markup for the application, including:

- The main title and description.
- Category buttons for filtering.
- A grid layout for displaying product images.
- The jQuery script to enable filtering functionality and animations.

### CSS Styling

The styles are embedded within the HTML file, ensuring a simple design that is **mobile-responsive**. **Media queries** ensure that the layout adjusts based on the screen size.

### JavaScript (jQuery)

The jQuery script provides the filtering functionality:

- When a category button is clicked, it hides all products, then shows the products belonging to the selected category.
- The active button state is updated dynamically to provide visual feedback on the selected filter.

## Responsive Design

### Desktop:

The page shows products in multiple columns.

### Tablet:

The layout switches to **two columns**.

### Mobile:

The layout adjusts to a **single column** for easy viewing.

## Media Queries

- For screens with a width of **768px** or less, the layout changes to display **2 columns**.
- For screens with a width of **480px** or less, the layout switches to a **single column** to optimize for smaller devices.
